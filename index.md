## My Journey With Programming for Data Science and Statistics so far:

### Independent Projects:
These are extensions of, or entirely new, projects that I have been working on recently:

NOTE: THIS IS NOT MY PROJECT
I have forked and dowloaded the YOLO machine vision framework in order to teach myself more of the intricacies of machine vision via Convolutional Neural Networks. These skills will be used to combine the features that were generated in the Client Project with low-res satellite data in order to generate models that better predict locations and extents of informal housing.


### General Assembly Projects:
In March of 2020, I joined the Data Science Immersive Fellowship at General Assembly. I did this in order to learn more effective ways to manipulate and derive insight from data than the tools I already knew (eg. Excel). I was particularly interested in how better to visualize and communicate my findings. My background is in Analytical and Organic Chemistry, with a hefty steeping in compliance and Quality Assurance, and as such I am already well versed in a large portion of the relevant statistical concepts. What follows are some of the projects that I worked on while in attendance. 

#### Capstone Project: Visualizing UCR/NIBRS Data - Building a data dashboard with Dash and Plotly:
This project represents my first attempts at handling real world data and visualizing it in a meaningful way using Python. The intent was to develop a fully functional data dashboard that would allow users to select features and visualize data and trends intuitively via Dash/Plotly. Unfortunately, the data were inconsistently formatted excel files. As such, a large portion of time spent on this project was the cleaning of data - a real world reinforcement of the fact that about 90% of what Data Scientists do is munge, impute, and encode data. A rudimentary dashboard has been created, and since I've managed to get a subscription for Tableau through my non-profit, it may be a while before I revisit Dash.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mdevay/mdevay.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
