## My Journey With Programming for Data Science and Statistics so far:

### Independent Projects:
These are extensions of, or entirely new, projects that I have been working on recently:

#### Visualizing UCR/NIBRS with Tableau:
Dash and Plotly are amazing tools for generating web-enabled interactive graphics. The learning curve is steep but short and there is excellent documentation. However, their use and polish lend themselves more towards embedding in a blog post than actually building a polished dashboard. Tableau combines good design principles with powerful analytics capability, and while the product may seem a little boilerplate if you look at a lot of Tableau dashboards, getting those finicky little formatting things to work exactly how you want them sometiems requires a bit more of a web dev background when working with Dash. The result (<- link to tab public dash) is a much better representation of what I was trying to achieve in my Capstone. 

NOTE: THIS IS NOT MY PROJECT

I have forked and dowloaded the YOLO machine vision framework in order to teach myself more of the intricacies of machine vision via Convolutional Neural Networks. These skills will be used to combine the features that were generated in the Client Project with low-res satellite data in order to generate models that better predict locations and extents of informal housing.


### General Assembly Projects:
In March of 2020, I joined the Data Science Immersive Fellowship at General Assembly. I did this in order to learn more effective ways to manipulate and derive insight from data than the tools I already knew (eg. Excel). I was particularly interested in how better to visualize and communicate my findings. My background is in Analytical and Organic Chemistry, with a hefty steeping in product compliance, continual improvement, and QA/QC. As such, I am already well versed in a large portion of the relevant statistical concepts. What follows are some of the projects that I worked on while in attendance. 

#### Capstone Project: Visualizing UCR/NIBRS Data - Building a data dashboard with Dash and Plotly:
This project represents my first attempts at handling real world data and visualizing it in a meaningful way using Python. The intent was to develop a fully functional data dashboard that would allow users to select features and visualize data and trends intuitively via Dash/Plotly. Unfortunately, the data were inconsistently formatted excel files. As such, a large portion of time spent on this project was the cleaning of data - a real world reinforcement of the fact that about 90% of what Data Scientists do is munge, impute, and encode data. A rudimentary dashboard was created, but intended functionality was not realized. Ultimately, this project taught me that I can probably make a tight deadline with either unfamiliar data, or unfamiliar tools, but trying to work with both in a crunch is indavisable. More information can be found in the README and notebooks. Expect future updates for this project, as both mastery of Dash and the data both are of great interest to me.

#### Client Project: Developing New Features for Existing Machine Vision Models for Detecting Informal Housing:
This project was prompted by an actual client request. (Company Name) presented GA with a series of Problem Statements and prompts for consulting projects relevant to their business. Our team selected a project, for which the primary deliverable was a feature based on the ratio of real estate adverts to population density. We used Selenium to scrape real estate listing data from the most popular online real estate platform in Nairobi. We then used Google Cloud API to geocode the resulting dataset based on the listing address or location. We then used K-Means Clustering on the Facebook/Cambridge High Resolution Population Density Maps, and generated a feature that represented the ratio of real estate adverts for each cluster to the population of that cluster.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mdevay/mdevay.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
